This current building replaced an original Ballplayers House at the same site, which stood from 1873 to 1969. This quaint red and cream brick structure with its red-checkered tablecloths and green umbrellas serves up all of its items made to order. Besides the typical ""Take me out to the ball game"" fare, such as hot dogs and hamburgers, patrons will be pleased to find sandwiches and salads at reasonable prices. While dining outdoors, patrons can watch some of the baseball or softball games in action. Music from the nearby Carousel can be heard as it mingles with the cheers and jeers of the crowds as the crack of a bat hits a ball through the air.","Snack Bar","","","(212) 874-7454","","","","40.770313","-73.975901","","","Battery Gardens Restaurant"

The book stalls were created to emulate the stalls on Paris' Left Bank.  Benjamin Bass founded the Strand Book Store in 1927 in an area of New York City called Book Row of America, where forty-eight bookstores lined the street from Union Square to Astor Place. Strand is the only remaining Book Row bookstore and is still owned by the Bass family. Today, the Strand Book Store is the largest independent bookstore in New York City, with over ""18 miles of books"" in its 35,000 square foot store.

"2014-04-24","2024-04-23","M10(34)-R","The Sheepfold in Central Park, constructed in the latter half of the 19th century at the same time as the Tweed Courthouse on Chambers Street (now home to the New York City Department of Education) is one of the City's finest examples of Victorian Gothic architecture and one of the Park's most treasured landmarked buildings. Presently a restaurant named Tavern on the Green, the building is the best surviving work of the British architect and ornamentalist, Jacob Wrey Mould (1825-1886).<BR><BR>

Mould is also responsible for other Park treasures including the carvings and the Minton tile arcade at Bethesda Terrace, the pavilions at Belvedere Castle, and many of the Park's ornamental bridges, designed in collaboration with Calvert Vaux. <BR><BR>

Constructed of ""the best Colobaugh brick,"" local granite, and blue and gray Malden stone, the decorative elements of the building's facade are still intact despite twentieth century additions. The original U-shaped building had three elements: the Sheepfold proper (now the open air terrace and glassed-in Crystal Room); the residence of the Keeper and his men; and the open Loggie and their balconies. The northern and southern extremities of the building faced ""the Green,"" which became known, appropriately, as the Sheep Meadow. The present windows, flanked by red granite columns and decorative stone and tilework, may have once been part of the open air structure. The interior and possibly exterior flooring was originally paved with Minton encaustic tiles. Completing the compound, adjacent to the main building were barns and lofts for storage of feed for the sheep. <BR><BR>

The preliminary sketch for the building was published in the First Annual Report of the Department of Public Parks of 1871. Many construction drawings for the building are in the Municipal Archives of the City of New York. <BR><BR>

Parks Commissioner Robert Moses converted the Sheepfold (which actually housed 200 South Down sheep that grazed across the street) into a restaurant named Tavern on the Green, which opened to the public on October 20, 1934. New Yorkers quickly embraced this new eatery and it soon became an integral part of the City's social life. From the late 1930s until 1943, the restaurant was closed and the building was used as the headquarters for the Civilian Patrol Corps. The restaurant reopened in 1943 under new management and was renovated into a year-round facility. By the 1950s, the structure was showing some wear and tear and underwent a further renovation by the designer Raymond Loewy. At that time the restaurant had been expanded to serve more than 1,200 diners and the number of parking spaces was doubled. A succession of management companies operated the restaurant until well-known New York restaurateur Warner LeRoy acquired the license in 1973. The revitalized restaurant became a popular destination for tourists and New Yorkers alike.  <BR><BR>","Restaurant","","","212-877-8684","","http://tavernonthegreen.com/","","40.772198","-73.977780","","","Terrace on the Park"

Inspired by the World Fair Pavilions, a cable supported canopy roof is suspended over the ice skating rink.  Designed as part of the 2012 Olympic Bid, the design allows for the walls running the length of the facility to potentially be removed for  expansion to a larger venue with a bleacher structure.  Like the construction of the Works Progress Administration era, simple materials are used to create this stunning architecture.  In this case, pre-cast concrete panels are punctuated with color glass tile to create the exterior and a three story glass lobby provides a dramatic introduction to the building.<BR><BR>

The World Ice Arena features a full-size, 17,000 square foot ice rink surface with ceiling heights between 40 and 60 feet.  The ice rink and pool complex is the largest recreational facility ever built in a New York City Park and serves as a year-round complex for competitive and recreational skaters.<BR><BR>
